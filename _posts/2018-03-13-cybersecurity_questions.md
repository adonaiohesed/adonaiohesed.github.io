# Comprehensive Cybersecurity Interview Questions & Answers

## Basic Cybersecurity Fundamentals

**Q: What is the CIA triangle?**

A: The CIA Triad represents the three core principles of information security:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
- **Availability**: Ensuring information and resources are accessible when needed

**Q: What is the Cyber Kill Chain?**

1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command & Control
7. Actions on Objectives

**Q: What is MITRE ATT&CK?**

A: A globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations, used for developing threat models and methodologies.

**Q: Explain the difference between Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk.**

A: 
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that could be exploited
- **Threat**: A potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability
- **Risk**: The likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

**Q: What is the difference between Vulnerability Assessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT)?**

A: 
- **VA**: Automated scanning to identify known vulnerabilities
- **PT**: Manual testing that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to determine actual risk

**Q: What is the difference between Events, Alerts, and Incidents?**

A: 
- **Event**: Any observable occurrence in a system
- **Alert**: A notification triggered by specific criteria or thresholds
- **Incident**: A confirmed security breach or violation requiring response

**Q: What are APT Groups?**

A: Advanced Persistent Threat groups are sophisticated, well-resourced attackers (often nation-state sponsored) who conduct long-term, targeted attacks against specific organizations.

## Encryption and Cryptography

**Q: What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric (public-key) cryptography?**

A: 
- **Symmetric**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (faster, but key distribution challenge)
- **Asymmetric**: Uses a pair of keys (public/private) - encrypt with one, decrypt with the other

**Q: What is Encryption, Encoding, and Hashing?**

A: 
- **Encryption**: Converting data to protect confidentiality (reversible with key)
- **Encoding**: Converting data for compatibility/transmission (easily reversible)
- **Hashing**: One-way function creating fixed-length output (irreversible)

**Q: What is Salting in the context of Hashing, and why is it used?**

A: Salting adds random data to passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks and ensure identical passwords produce different hashes.

**Q: Would you Encrypt and Compress or Compress and Encrypt? Why?**

A: Encrypting data before compressing it is inefficient, as the compression will not work effectively on encrypted data. On the other hand, compressing data before encrypting it is efficient but can expose it to the risk of side-channel attacks. Given this trade-off, in sensitive contexts, it is often best to avoid compression altogether and only use encryption.

**Q: How does the Three-way Handshake work?**

A: TCP connection establishment process:
1. Client sends SYN packet
2. Server responds with SYN-ACK packet
3. Client sends ACK packet
Connection is now established.
