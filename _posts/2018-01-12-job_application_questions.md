## What exceptional work have you done? - Tell us about a piece of work that you are most roud about.

The project I am currently leading at my company is what I am most proud of. I designed a new pipeline that had not existed within the company before and developed a new automation process based on it. This initiative has not only impacted my team but also the entire cybersecurity department, as well as other teams like the M&A team, Legal team, and 3rd Party Risk team, by significantly reducing risks across the organization.

One of the most notable achievements of this project is that it successfully replaced an external vendor product, resulting in 100% cost savings. As the only cost-saving project in our team, it has received significant recognition. Over the past three years, I’ve taken the project beyond the PoC phase to build it into a fully operational in-house product. Although the project’s importance was not well understood by my team members initially, it is now widely recognized as a critical initiative, and many agree that it would be difficult for someone else to take over its leadership. Being able to lead and develop such an impactful project from the ground up has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me.
